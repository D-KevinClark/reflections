When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you work with someone else on one same project or you have a project that you will work on when you at different place.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
so you can always stay focus on you current work and make the update when you want to.
